# 🧠 Resume Parser with Agentic Flow

This project automates the extraction of key resume information from PDFs using modular **agent-based architecture**. It separates responsibilities like name detection, contact extraction, education, work experience, and skills into independent components (agents), making the system scalable and easy to maintain.
